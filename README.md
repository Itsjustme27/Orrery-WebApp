Since a mechanical model of the solar system was presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, in 1713, such models have been referred to as orreries. The first orreries were physical models, but today we can use numerous tools to create virtual orreries that have many more features than their ancient mechanical counterparts. Your challenge is to create an interactive orrery web app that is embedded in a webpage and displays celestial bodies such as planets, Near-Earth Asteroids, Near-Earth Comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.
